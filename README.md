### Python for data analysis project with QSAR biodegradation dataset

So the dataset I am working on is the QSAR biodegradation dataset available here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation
The purpose of this work is to build a model able to predict if a chemical is ready biodegradable or not.
First of all let's proceed with the data exploratory:

## Data Exploratory :

**Structural analysis :**

First let's analyse the structure of the given dataset.

We notice that the names of the feature are not in the dataset so we copy them in a file 'description.txt' to add them in the dataset.

- Target variable: 'experimental class' -> binary variable
- Rows and columns: 1055 rows 42 columns
- Variable types: 24 parameters are integers, 17 are float and 1 is object (the response)
- Missing values: No missing values
